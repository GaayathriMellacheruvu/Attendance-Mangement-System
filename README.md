# Attendance-Mangement-System

# Abstract
The Attendance Management System is a tool that facilitates the management of student data and attendance records in educational institutions. It allows universities and colleges to efficiently maintain attendance details for students, and it can track and store all the relevant information from the beginning to the end of a course for reporting and attendance tracking purposes.
Due to the difficulty of manually computing attendance percentages and the potential for errors and wasted time, a web-based application has been developed to record student attendance electronically and store it in a database. The system uses the Model, View, and Controller (MVC) architecture and is implemented with the Laravel Framework. JavaScript is utilized to enhance system usability, and MySQL is used for the application database. The system can differentiate between theoretical and practical sessions, which have different rates of attendance calculation, and a graphical user interface (GUI) is provided for easy manipulation of the data.
The software is updated daily to reflect student attendance and staff members are given unique login credentials to modify student status. Subject-specific staff members are responsible for recording attendance for all students in a class, and attendance is only marked when a student is present during a particular period. Weekly reports on student attendance are generated and consolidated.

# Introduction
To efficiently gather and manage all staff information, a data framework is necessary. This proposed framework aims to simplify the user experience by utilizing XAMPP Server interfaced with a database and employing PHP language as the framework guideline. The framework acts as a standalone system focused on recording and updating information, with all student data being stored in their respective database. This approach eliminates issues such as data confusion and loss. Additionally, the framework allows for periodic checks of student status, which can be done more efficiently than with the current system.
All information is securely maintained on XAMPP servers under the supervision of college authorities, ensuring the highest level of security. This framework provides flexibility to expand and enhance the college's record management system while minimizing the amount of manual labor required to provide understandable information to users. Traditionally, educational institutions relied on paper records for attendance tracking, which is a time-consuming and challenging process to manage.
The most significant feature of this designed software is its flexibility and responsiveness as a web-based application. The framework allows users to access the software anytime and anywhere. The software is designed to record student details, including their subjects, teachers, number of hours, and time, for the AI&DS department. The daily attendance of students is taken automatically by selecting their name and subject, and marking their attendance status. By clicking the save button, the information is stored in the database, and the attendance report is automatically generated, saving time and reducing errors.
